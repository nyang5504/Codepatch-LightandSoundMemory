# Light and Sound Memory Game

1.	If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

I did not use any outside resources to complete my work.

2.	What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

One challenge that I encountered during the prework was finishing the logic in the guess function. I did not clearly what the declared global variables were supposed to be used for and thus did not know how to implement the logic to include the right variable. I overcame this by studying the flow chart given in detail. This helped me understand that guessCounter was to be used for each single guess, while progress was to keep track of what round we were up to. Each round would have progress+1 number of buttons to guess. I knew that there was a solution given by Codepath, but I really wanted to implement the logic of this function on my own, so I decided that it was my last resort. Fortunately, I was able to implement the logic myself without looking at the given solution which gave me a sense of accomplishment which makes me love coding.

3.	What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

The game that I created using glitch does not include much of a back-end/database. Logins and sign-ups are often part of websites and it’s something we did not touch upon in this project. I’ve had some experience with databases, but I still have a difficult time understanding how it is incorporated and used together with the front-end.

4.	If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

If I were to add additional features to the project, I would like to make this game continuous while also adding a score keeper. The purpose is to make the user want to beat their own scores and through it gain a sense of achievement. 8 notes might not be challenging enough for users to really enjoy.
I think that different modes of difficulty might also be a good feature to add. I would create an easy, medium, and hard mode with each working at a faster pace than the previous. Many games have such an option, and it gives the user a reason/desire to continue playing the game because it doesn’t get boring as quickly.
